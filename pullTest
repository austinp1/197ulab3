Go to the GitHub web interface, and go to your repository. You’ll be able to make a new file by clicking
the “Create new file” button. Name it whatever you’d like and fill in some content. Make sure you
use a detailed commit message.
Now pull the change you made from the web interface to your local repository. Validate that your file
you created in the web interface is in your local repository.
Q: What command did you use to pull the remote commit to your local repository? What was the
output of the command?
